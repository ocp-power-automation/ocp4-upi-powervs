## Introduction

The `ocp4-upi-powervs` [project](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-powervs) provides Terraform based automation code to help with the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x on [IBM® Power Systems™ Virtual Server on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/power-virtual-server).

This project leverages the helpernode [ansible playbook](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode) internally for OCP deployment on IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers (PowerVS).

## Before You Start

This branch must be used with OCP 4.10.x versions only.

The [main](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-powervs/tree/master) branch must be used with latest OCP pre-release versions only. 
Ensure you checkout the correct `release-VERSION` branch depending on the version (4.5, 4.6 ...) of RedHat OpenShift you want to install:
	
For example to use OCP 4.10 perform the following
```
export VERSION=4.10
git clone --single-branch --branch release-$VERSION https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-powervs.git
```
