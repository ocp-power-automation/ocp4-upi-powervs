# Introduction

This repo contains Terraform templates to help deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.5.x releases on [IBM® Power Systems™ Virtual Server on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/power-virtual-server).

This project leverages the [helpernode ansible playbook](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode) internally to install and configure services required for running OCP on IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers (PowerVS).
